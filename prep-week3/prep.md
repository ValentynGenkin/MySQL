- Was your database already in 2NF / 3 NF?
- What changes did you have to do to normalize your database?
My database corresponds to 2NF and 3NF rules and I didn’t make corrections in tables structure.
- If you want to add thousands of recipes to your database, what challenges do you foresee?
The most challenging part (if i do it manually) will be filling junction tables because of the IDs doesn’t include visible information and this is right way to make a lot of mistakes.
